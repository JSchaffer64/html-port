<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Birmingham, AL but I now live in Cullman, AL which is about 40 miles north. I am very close to my family and see them just about every day. I am married and have one awesome 2 year old.
    My sons name is Davie. He is really into bugs, monster trucks, and anything with the ocean. He definitely keeps both my wife and I busy.</p>

<p>One thing I really enjoy is playing video games. I have a pc here at home and I play almost every type of game. I have invested a lot of hours into Apex Legends, Diablo 4, and Minecraft.
</p>
<p>I watch a lot of anime in my free time as well. If I had to pick a top 3 it would have to be Solo Leveling, Jujustu Kaisen, and Naruto in that order.
    I also watch The Office, Star Wars, or movies that I haven't seen (I have a list I keep) when I run into a lot of filler episodes in Naruto.</p>
